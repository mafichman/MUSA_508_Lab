## What is in here?

The labs in this repo are arranged by week and mainly follows the curriculum, but we may diverge as needed. The code samples in this repo are about 85% of what you need to be able to complete the homework assignments and mid-term. With the text in these labs, our live instruction and through assignments you will learn to modify and add to this code to personalize your work.

Additional content is available in the [R FAQ for Planners](https://mafichman.github.io/R_FAQ_For_Planners/) document which covers a wide range of frequently asked questions (FAQ) and hurdles that students face. This FAQ should be a source you turn to when you run into a problem.
